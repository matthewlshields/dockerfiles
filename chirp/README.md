# Chirp

[CHIRP](https://chirp.danplanet.com/projects/chirp) is a free, open-source tool for programming your amateur radio.

Still not done, but checking in my code.

Credit where credit is due -- I used [docker-chirp](https://github.com/linuxluser/docker-chirp) by [linuxluser](https://github.com/linuxluser) as the starting point for my image.
